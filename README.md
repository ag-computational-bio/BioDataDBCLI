# DatahandlerCLI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ag-computational-bio/BioDataDBCLI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ag-computational-bio/BioDataDBCLI)

This is a simple cli application to upload files into the BioDataDB.

The implementation at the moment very rudimentary and mainly used for testing purposes. Additional features will be added in the future.

- Uploading multiple files
- Parallelize file upload

## Usage
At first an api token with sufficient rights is required to be generated from the website which in turn requires an oauth2 account.
Then a dataset version has to be created which the data object is associated with.

```yaml
Config:
  GRPCEndpoint:
    Host: localhost
    Port: 9000
```
- Config.GRPCEndpoint.Host is the hostname to access the BioDataDB backend
- Config.GRPCEndpoint.Post is the port to access the BioDataDB backend


Example:
```shell
./datahandlercli upload -c <configfilepath> -d <datasetversion> -f <filepath> -token <api token>
```

In addition a config file has to be provie
